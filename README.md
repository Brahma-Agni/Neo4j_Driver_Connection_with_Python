Hi, budding developers and friends,

I have made a Python-Neo4j connection with a gui Tkinter along with pickel module.

this project have data in the neo4j graph database, i retrived the data and placed it in the GUI application which has a search function to search about researchers,

data I have given in the frictional and not real, I dont possess the correct dataset so I didnt do it in that way,

feel free to use the code.

thank you for visiting.
